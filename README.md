##  Overview

This project uses JavaScript's `setTimeout` to mimic my usual daily schedule. With surprises in between, it begins with me pressing the snooze button on my alarm clock and concludes with me reading before bed. Timed delays are used to make each activity appear one after the other, giving the impression that the day is going by slowly.

This is more akin to a digital journal of my real rhythm than it is a script.

##  Project Goals

- Practice sequencing events with `setTimeout()`.
- Show a complete (and occasionally disorganized) daily schedule; customize each task to reflect my actual routine; and add a surprise twist or mood to create an element of unpredictability.
- Examine the asynchronous behavior of JavaScript.

##  How to Run the Simulation

1. Launch your browser and navigate to `dailySimulation.html`.  
2. Take a seat back and observe how the events unfold sequentially.
3. Every step reflects a task I complete throughout the day.

> Try refreshing a few times; each time, the surprise at 3:00 PM is different!

##  What Makes It Mukwayaâ€™s

- A combination of serious and humorous moments (such as dozing off while brushing your teeth.)
- An unexpected afternoon mood "burst" featuring a random emoji.
- A customized timetable for working on other modules and CS 81.
- Original remarks that are written so that *I* could explain them to another person.
